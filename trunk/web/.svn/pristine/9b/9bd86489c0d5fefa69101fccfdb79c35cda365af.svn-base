                        <p class="limited-line-3">Software development is the series of activities that builds up software product. Generally speaking, there are several phases in software development, such as requirement, design, implementation and maintenanceâ€¦etc. We follow the principles of software development to deal with DBSE projects. Sometimes problems have occurred during project development, they probably would be good research motivations to be accomplished. Use Case and Refactoring are both the frequent activities that we often decide to carry out. </p>

                        <p class="limited-line-3">We are experienced lab. for computer science education. Computer Science Course students are potential software engineers in the future. On the course, students realize software development by programming homework practicing. Teaching Assist(TA) designs homework assignment and evaluate the programming homework. Course students writing programs to match assignment, upload program and document, and waiting for evaluation result. In this process, we are interested in program learning improvement, rapid program evaluation response, and automation of TA management process. </p>

We are interested in factors of success open source project and process of open source software development. With these issues, we are devoted to model source development process and assist open source development process.</p>
